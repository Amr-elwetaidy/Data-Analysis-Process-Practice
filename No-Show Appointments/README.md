# Investigating No-Show Appointments Dataset.

## Introduction
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

I will be analyizing this dataset to explore What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
